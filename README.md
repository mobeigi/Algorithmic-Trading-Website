Algorithmic Trading Website
=========
**This was part of the project outcome for the SENG3011 course in Semester 1, 2015**

This website was used to host the downloads for the Algorithmic Trading application.
The website is very minimalistic and simple. It was designed to be quick.
AJAX-type loading is achomplished using AngularJS which allows each page to load without a page refresh.
The software download page retrieves information about each build from a JSON file which was regularly updated by the team.
OS and architecture detection were also added to streamline the download process.
